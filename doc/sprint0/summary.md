# Chroma Notes Project Summary

**Project Objective:** Build a note-taking app that allows users to create notes and personalize them. The web application will allow users to write down notes, edit and delete them, and customize their appearance through features such as colour themes. It will also allow users to filter notes using tags, and organize them into folders.

**Key Personas:**
* Emma Moore - A 20 year old student in her third year of psychology at York University, who also works part-time at the library. With a busy schedule and constant approaching deadlines, Emma always has a lot on her mind, and not enough time to organize her thoughts.

* David Rodriguez - A 42 year old senior event manager at a hotel in the city. David is a perfectionist who takes pride in his work; one tiny mistake or forgotten piece of information could make all his event planning be futile.

* Danika Nowak - A 28 year old freelance fashion designer, working in the city and keeping company with her cat. She expresses herself through her art, finding freedom through her artistic vision, though sometimes losing track of time in the process. 

**Key Scenarios:**
* It's exam season, and Emma needs to study for her five classes, while also making sure she remembers when her shifts at the library are. She needs an organized system to note down her tasks, and separate them depending on the topic. She also needs to jot down upcoming dates and deadlines, and be notified when they are approaching. 

* David has a big conference coming up, and she cannot have anything out of place. He needs a fast, responsive app that will allow him to quickly jot down notes during planning meetings. He also needs to have a way to quickly identify unique contacts, using colour coordination. 

* Danika is struggling to find new clientele, and she needs to organize her thoughts and come up with some new ideas. She needs a way to express how she is feeling in a way that will resonate with her artistic mind, and she also needs to brainstorm some new designs. Danika needs to separate her personal emotions and her business, with unique fonts and styles for each.


**Key Principles:** 

* Focus on personalization: Give users the freedom to make their notes their own - the app will provide different colour settings to allow users to make their notes visually unique, and it will provide the option to give notes tags, in order to group them as the user sees fit.

* Organization and easy access: Users can separate their notes under different folders and tags, making them visually distinct and easy to access.
