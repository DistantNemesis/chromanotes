## Existing Products  
Evernote - https://evernote.com/  
* Supports rich formatting, tags, and multimedia but places advanced features such as widgets, custom dashboards, note templates, task reminders, and custom notifications behind a paywall.  

Notion - https://www.notion.so/  
* Highly flexible as it’s not just a notes app, it’s an all-in-one workspace that combines features such as note-taking; task management; databases and spreadsheets; wikis and documentation; and team collaboration. Due to this great flexibility and complexity, it can come with a steep learning curve for new users that may deter them away. 

Microsoft OneNote - https://onenote.com/  
* Mimics a traditional notebook structure – with Notebooks -> Sections -> Pages -> Subpages. While it is great for organizing large amounts of material, it can feel visually cluttered and overcomplicated for users that are simply looking to just jot down simple notes.  

## How Our Product Is Different  
* User customization tools: Users can select from multiple colour themes, adjust typography when writing notes, and personalize their note editor layout.  
* Modular note organization: Notes can be organized into folders; given tags so you can organize, search, and auto-group them into folders; pinned visually according to user-defined categories so they get placed in a special area that makes them easier to find.  
* Flexible interface: Users can toggle between compact and detailed views, and adjust the note layout.  

## Target Users & Scenarios  
* Students that want to personalize their workspace to fit different subjects or moods by color-coding.  
* Writers and researchers that prefer an organized work environment but want a visually distinct environment that enhances focus.  
* Casual users who would enjoy the aesthetic aspect of customizing their note-taking to reflect their personalities.  

## Why Competitors Didn’t Focus on These Scenarios  
* Notion and Evernote provide flexibility to users but restrict full aesthetic customization in favor of maintaining a consistent brand identity.  
* Microsoft OneNote is optimized for a corporate and academic demographic, not so much for visual or creative customization.  

## Summary  
* ChromaNotes fills in the gap that exists in the current landscape of note-taking tools by putting a user’s customization and personalization first. It is simple, customizable and personal. It’s a note-taking app that feels exactly how the user wants it to – not how the developers decide it should.
