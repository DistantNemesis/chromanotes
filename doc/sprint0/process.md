# Process


## How did we organize the team?

We organized our team by assigning responsibilities based on each member’s strengths. Araz designed the user interface prototype, Victoria developed the user personas, Rav wrote the competition analysis, and Giuseppe completed the project summary and done definition. However, each member reviewed each task all together, and gave eachother advice. We identified the user stories as a group. We did not need to use any tools in order to get us organized.

## How did you make decisions?
We made decisions by discussing topics as a group on Discord and having votes when needed. 

## How frequently did you meet?

We have been meeting on Discord two times per week to check each user's progress on the the tasks they've been assigned.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase? 

Moving forward, we should keep having open communication, checking in with each other and not being afraid to ask for questions or opinions from the team.
