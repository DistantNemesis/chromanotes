The user can change the application's background theme through the Sidebar. Selecting a theme updates the overall styling of the interface,   
including the header, sidebar, notes list, and modal components.
Theme selection is handled in React state, and the chosen theme applies dynamic Tailwind classes to the layout.   
This allows the entire UI to immediately switch between light, dark, or pastel modes. The theme enhances readability and personalization without affecting   
note content or data stored in the backend.  

Clicking the archive icon on a note toggles its archived status. Archived notes no longer appear in the main notes list   
but can still be viewed by selecting the "Archived Notes" option in the Sidebar.  
When a note is archived, it automatically becomes unpinned to prevent inconsistencies in the pinned notes section.   
The NotesList component only displays archived notes when the archived filter is active. Clicking the archive icon again restores the note to the regular notes list.  

The user can set a reminder when creating or editing a note in the NoteForm component. Selecting the "Set Reminder" checkbox reveals date and time inputs,   
which are converted into an ISO String and sent to the backend with the rest of the note data.
When the reminder time is reached, the backend emits a Socket.IO event. The frontend listens for this event in HomePage.jsx and   
displays a pop-up notification containing the note’s title, reminder time, and message.  
A reminder icon also appears on notes that have future reminders, indicating that a notification is scheduled.  
Clicking the edit button allows the user to modify or remove the reminder as needed.
