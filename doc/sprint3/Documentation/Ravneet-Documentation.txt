1. models/Note.js (Reminder support)
Purpose (unchanged):
Defines the Note MongoDB schema using Mongoose.
Sprint 3 Additions (US12 – Reminders):
New fields (used by the controllers + scheduler):
reminderTime: Date – optional timestamp for when the user wants to be reminded about a note.
reminderSent: Boolean – tracks whether the reminder for this note has already been sent.
These fields are now set and updated through createNote / updateNote in notesController.js, and consumed by reminderScheduler.js to trigger one-time notifications.

2. controllers/notesController.js (ReminderTime support)
Purpose (existing):
Handles business logic for all note operations (CRUD, pinning, tagging, exporting, image upload, etc.).
Sprint 3 Additions (US12 – Reminders):
createNote(req, res)
Now accepts reminderTime from req.body in addition to styling fields.
When a note is created, it initializes:
reminderTime – saved as provided by the frontend.
reminderSent: false – ensures the scheduler knows this note still needs a reminder.
updateNote(req, res)
Now also accepts and updates reminderTime.
Resets reminderSent to false on every update so that:
If the user changes the reminder time, a new reminder can be sent at the updated time.
The scheduler only sends the reminder once per configured date/time.

3. models/Setting.js (Background theme settings)
Purpose (US10 – Background theme):
Stores global application settings related to UI appearance. Currently used to persist the selected background theme.
Behavior:
Uses an enum to strictly validate allowed themes: ["light", "dark", "pastel"].
Defaults to "light" when no explicit theme is set.
Designed to be used as a singleton settings document (findOne() / findOneAndUpdate()).
Sprint 3:
This entire model was added in Sprint 3 to support persistent background theme customization.

4. routes/settingsRoutes.js
Purpose (US10 – Background theme):
Defines the REST API endpoints for reading and updating application settings, specifically the background theme.
Behavior:
Delegates all logic to settingsController.js.
Typically mounted under a base path such as /api/settings.
Sprint 3:
New router added to expose backend settings APIs to the frontend.

5. controllers/settingsController.js
Purpose (US10 – Background theme):
Implements the business logic for retrieving and updating UI settings in MongoDB.
Functions:
getSettings(req, res)
Fetches the single settings document using Setting.findOne().
If no document exists (first run), it creates one with default values (backgroundTheme defaults to "light").
Returns the current settings to the client.
updateSettings(req, res)
Reads backgroundTheme from req.body.
Validates that it is one of: "light", "dark", "pastel".
If invalid, returns HTTP 400 with a clear error message.
Uses Setting.findOneAndUpdate({}, { backgroundTheme }, { new: true, upsert: true }) to:
Update the existing settings document, or
Create one if it doesn’t exist.
Returns the updated settings document.
Sprint 3 Additions:
Entire settings controller added this sprint to support saving and loading the user’s theme choice.

6. schedulers/reminderScheduler.js
Purpose (US12 – Reminders):
Background scheduler that periodically checks for due reminders and triggers real-time notifications.
Key Responsibilities:
Uses node-cron to schedule a job that runs every minute
Ensures strict validation and a single source of truth for background theme configuration.
On each run:
Gets the current timestamp: const now = new Date();
Queries the Note collection for notes that:
Have a reminderTime less than or equal to now
Have reminderSent: false
For each matching note:
Calls sendNotification(note) from notificationService.js
Sets note.reminderSent = true and saves the note, ensuring each reminder is only sent once.
Sprint 3 Additions:
New scheduler module introduced in Sprint 3.
Implements the core logic of the reminder feature and connects notes data with real-time notifications.

7. services/notificationService.js
Purpose (US12 – Reminders):
Provides a single function to emit reminder notifications to connected clients over Socket.io.
Key Responsibilities:
Imports the initialized Socket.io server instance from server.js
Exposes sendNotification(note)
Emits a "reminder" event over Socket.io
Logs a message to the backend console for debugging
Behavior:
Designed to be used by reminderScheduler.js, but can also be reused for other notification triggers in the future (e.g., manual reminders).
Uses a single broadcast (io.emit) so every connected client can receive the reminder event and decide how to display it (e.g., toast notifications).
Sprint 3 Additions:
Entire service added this sprint as part of the reminder feature.
Decouples notification delivery from scheduling logic.
