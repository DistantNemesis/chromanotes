The notesRoutes file defines the API routes for handling notes. A new route was added for updating notes using a PUT request. 
This route waits for requests sent to /api/notes/:id, where :id represents the note’s unique identifier. 
When a request is made to this route, the updateNote controller function is called from notesController file.

The notesController file contains the logic for performing CRUD operations on notes. The updateNote function was added to handle editing an existing note.
It extracts the title and content from the request body, finds the note by its ID in the database, and updates it with the new data.
If the note exists, the updated note is returned in the response. If the note is not found, a 404 status code is returned.
If any other error occurs, a 500 status code is returned. This allows users to modify their notes directly through the Edit Note feature on the frontend.

In the Note.js file, new fields were introduced to store visual customization options for each note.
The color field was added to save the background color selected by the user, while the fontStyle and fontSize fields were added to store the text styling preferences for that note. Each of these fields were given a default value so that notes without explicit customization still function properly. 

The notesController file was also updated to support these new features. 
In the createNote function, the backend now accepts color, fontStyle and fontSize from the request body and includes them when creating the new note. This allows the frontend to send the user's chosen styling options and have them stored immediately when a note is created.
Similarly, the updateNote function was expanded to handle changes to a note's color, font style and font size. The function now extracts these additonal fields from the request body and updates the note in the database accordingly. 

The notesRoutes file was updated to support adding and removing images from notes.
A new POST route /api/notes/:id/images was added to upload images and store them with a note.
A DELETE route /api/notes/:id/images/:imageID was added to remove individual images from a note.

The notesController file was updated to support image handling.
The addImageToNote function saves uploaded images locally and stores the file path in the database.
The removeImageFromNote function deletes both the image file and its database reference.
The notesController file was also updated so that when a note is deleted, all images associated with it are removed from the backend.

The notesRoutes file was updated to allow exporting notes.
A new GET route /api/notes/:id/export allows users to export notes as files.

The exportNote function in the notesController file was added to generate either a PDF or TXT file.
TXT exports include the note title, content, and timestamps.
PDF exports include formatted content and any attached images.
If the note does not exist, a 404 error is returned. If the type parameter is missing, a 400 error is returned.

The notesRoutes file was updated to support archiving notes.
A new PATCH route /api/notes/:id/archive was added to archive or restore notes.
The notesController file was updated with the toggleArchiveNote function to change a note’s archived state.
The Note.js model was updated with a new archived field to store whether a note is archived.
