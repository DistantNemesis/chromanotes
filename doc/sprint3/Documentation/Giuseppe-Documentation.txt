Clicking the 'export' icon on a note brings up a pop-up menu where the user can pick what file format they'd like to export the note as.
Picking either pdf or txt will download the note to the user's device in the selected format.

The notes to be displayed are passed to the NotesList component depending on if the user has selected the pinned, archived, or tag buttons. Typing a word in the search bar
will filter the displayed notes passed to NotesList to only show those notes containing the keyword in the title or body of the note. Text is case insensitive. 

The user can add an image to a note when creating or editing the note with the NoteForm component. Clicking on the 'Attatch Image' button will open up the
user's file explorer, and allow an image file to be uploaded. The images they upload are then displayed. When the user clicks the 'Add Note' or 'Edit Note' buttons, 
the images are uploaded to the backend server through an API delete request in HomePage.jsx. The user can also delete notes from the NoteForm object. 
When a note is deleted, all images the note contained are also deleted.
