The notesRoutes file defines the API routes for handling notes. A new route was added for updating notes using a PUT request. 
This route waits for requests sent to /api/notes/:id, where :id represents the note’s unique identifier. 
When a request is made to this route, the updateNote controller function is called from notesController file.

The notesController file contains the logic for performing CRUD operations on notes. The updateNote function was added to handle editing an existing note.
It extracts the title and content from the request body, finds the note by its ID in the database, and updates it with the new data.
If the note exists, the updated note is returned in the response. If the note is not found, a 404 status code is returned.
If any other error occurs, a 500 status code is returned. This allows users to modify their notes directly through the Edit Note feature on the frontend.
