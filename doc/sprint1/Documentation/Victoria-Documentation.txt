The NotesList component manages the display and deletion of notes from the database. 
It has two states: one for storing the array of notes fetched from the API, and one for 
tracking the loading status during data operations.

When the component loads, it automatically fetches all notes from the /notes API endpoint 
and displays them. Each note is shown in a card format with its title and content.

When the delete button is clicked on any note card, the note is immediately removed from the 
UI, and a delete request is sent to the /notes/[id] API endpoint. If the deletion fails, 
the note is restored, and an error message is displayed.

The component handles multiple states, including loading messages while fetching data, 
empty state messages when no notes exist, and error notifications for failed operations.
