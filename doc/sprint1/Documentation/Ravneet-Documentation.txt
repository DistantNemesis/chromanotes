server.js
Purpose:
This is the entry point of the backend. It initializes the Express server, configures middleware, connects to MongoDB, and mounts the API routes.
Main Responsibilities:
Initialize and configure the Express app.
Apply middleware for JSON parsing and CORS.
Mount routes for /api/notes.
Connect to MongoDB using the connectDB() function.
Start the backend server on the designated port (default = 5001).
Behaviour Summary:
Once executed, the server listens for HTTP requests from the frontend (React app) and forwards them to the appropriate route handlers.

config/db.js
Purpose:
Handles connection between the backend and the MongoDB database using Mongoose.
Main Responsibilities:
Establish a connection to the MongoDB database.
Log successful or failed connections.
Exit the process if a connection error occurs.
Behaviour Summary:
This file ensures the backend is connected to MongoDB before handling API requests. It also ensures the app terminates gracefully on connection failure.

models/Note.js
Purpose:
Defines the data model (schema) for the Note collection in MongoDB using Mongoose.
Main Responsibilities:
Represent a “Note” as a document in MongoDB.
Enforce field structure and validation (title, content).
Enable automatic timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt).
Behaviour Summary:
This file defines how each note is structured in the database, ensuring consistency and validation before saving or updating.

routes/notesRoutes.js
Purpose:
Defines all API endpoints for the Note resource.
Each endpoint is linked to a controller function that executes the logic.
Main Responsibilities:
Define RESTful routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Pass requests to the appropriate controller functions.
Behaviour Summary:
This file acts as a routing layer between HTTP requests and business logic. It keeps the routes organized and decoupled from the main server logic.

controllers/notesController.js
Purpose:
Implements the business logic for all note-related operations — reading, creating, updating, and deleting notes.
Main Responsibilities:
Handle incoming requests from notesRoutes.js.
Interact with the Note model to perform CRUD operations.
Send back appropriate HTTP responses and status codes.
Handle errors and invalid inputs gracefully.
Behaviour Summary:
This controller acts as the business logic layer of the backend. It keeps the code modular and easy to maintain, separating logic from routing.
