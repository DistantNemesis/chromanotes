# Sprint 1 Retrospective

Participants: Ravneet, Giuseppe, Araz, Victoria

Unfinished User Stories:
- None

New Stories for Backlog:
- As a user, I want to be able to organize my notes into folders or categories so I can keep related ideas together
- As a user, I want to be able to assign tags to notes, so I can group them by topic
- As a user, I want to pin my important notes so that they always appear at the top of my workspace
- As a user, I want to colour-code my notes so that I can easily identify different topics and priorities
- As a user, I want to write in different font styles and sizes so that my notes are more readable and fit my preferences

Continue:
- Clear division of tasks
- Regular check-up sessions

Start:
- More code review prior to merging earlier on in the sprint

Stop:
- Not documenting our code ahead of time

Best Experience:
- Each individual having a clear idea on what user stories they're assigned to program

Worst Experience:
- Difficulty managing time effectively across the sprint alongside other courses, which occasionally led to rushed coordination near the deadline.
